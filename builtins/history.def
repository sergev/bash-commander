$PRODUCES history.c

$BUILTIN history
$FUNCTION history_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON HISTORY
$SHORT_DOC history [-c] [-d offset] [n] or history -awrn [filename] or history -ps arg [arg...]
Display the history list with line numbers.  Lines listed with
with a `*' have been modified.  Argument of N says to list only
the last N lines.  The `-c' option causes the history list to be
cleared by deleting all of the entries.  The `-d' option deletes
the history entry at offset OFFSET.  The `-w' option writes out the
current history to the history file;  `-r' means to read the file and
append the contents to the history list instead.  `-a' means
to append history lines from this session to the history file.
Argument `-n' means to read all history lines not already read
from the history file and append them to the history list.

If FILENAME is given, then that is used as the history file else
if $HISTFILE has a value, that is used, else ~/.bash_history.
If the -s option is supplied, the non-option ARGs are appended to
the history list as a single entry.  The -p option means to perform
history expansion on each ARG and display the result, without storing
anything in the history list.

If the $HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set and not null, its value is used
as a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated
with each displayed history entry.  No time stamps are printed otherwise.
